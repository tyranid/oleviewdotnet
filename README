OleViewDotNet is a .NET 4 application to provide a tool which merges the classic SDK tools
OleView and Test Container into one application. It allows you to find COM objects through
a number of different views (e.g. by CLSID, by ProgID, by server executable), enumerate
interfaces on the object and then create an instance and invoke methods. It also has a basic
container to attack ActiveX objects to so you can see the display output while manipulating
the data.
